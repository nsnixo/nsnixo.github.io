        The Prophecy
      </h2>
      <div class="chapter-content">
        <p>The blue light of my monitor was the only thing illuminating my room, casting long shadows that danced with the setting sun. On the screen, Mesum's desktop was a mirror into his world‚Äîa cluttered landscape of game icons and homework folders. Our voices, connected through a headset, were the familiar soundtrack to our evenings.</p>
        
        <p>"Check out this new level," he said, his cursor hovering over a game. But as he moved his mouse, a flash of pink and purple‚Äîa chat window‚Äîappeared and disappeared behind a browser tab.</p>
        
        <p>I leaned forward. "Whoa, hold up. What was that?"</p>
        <p>A pause. A digital heartbeat skipped. "What was what?"</p>
        <p>"That chat. Since when do you talk to anyone other than me and the guys after 8 PM?"</p>
        
        <p>I heard a nervous chuckle. This was new. Mesum, my anchor of shy sincerity, was flustered. He was the guy who would rather send a dozen texts than make a single phone call, especially to a girl.</p>
        
        <p>"It's‚Ä¶ no one. Just this girl."</p>
        <p>"Just this girl?" I teased, the words laced with brotherly suspicion. "Do tell."</p>
        <p>He sighed, a performance of reluctance. "Her name's Rida."</p>
        
        <p>And then, the masterstroke. He clicked on an audio file. The sound that came through my headset was crisp and clear, cutting through the static of our call. It was a girl's voice, light and melodic, yet with a confident edge.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">"My name is Rida."</div>
        
        <p>Five words. A simple introduction. But in the silent, blue-lit cave of my room, they felt like an incantation. There was a warmth to it, a genuineness that bypassed all my usual defenses. It wasn't just a voice; it was a character in a story I hadn't started reading yet. A strange, immediate sense of familiarity washed over me, a feeling I couldn't explain.</p>
        
        <p>I leaned back in my chair, a slow smile spreading across my face. The tease was forgotten, replaced by a sudden, profound certainty.</p>
        <div class="quote">"You know what, Mesum?" I said, the prophecy falling from my lips as if it had been waiting there all along. "Mark my words. One day, that girl‚ÄîRida‚Äîwill be my friend. Or maybe even my girlfriend."</div>
        
        <p>His laugh came quickly, a sharp, staccato sound. "Yeah, right. In your dreams, man."</p>
        <p>But now, with the benefit of hindsight, I know that laugh wasn't one of disbelief. It was the sound of a director hearing his lead actor perfectly recite the opening line of a script he himself had written. The curtain had risen, and I was the only one who didn't know the plot.</p>

        The Unanswered Calls
      </h2>
      <div class="chapter-content">
        <p>Weeks bled into one another, and the memory of Rida's voice faded from a vivid echo to a faint, almost-forgotten whisper. Life returned to its predictable rhythm: school, homework, and the easy, uncomplicated banter with Mesum that had defined most of my teenage years. The prophecy I'd uttered felt like a relic from a different era, a moment of whimsy lost to the relentless march of routine.</p>
        
        <p>It was on a Tuesday, I think, that the fabric of that routine first began to tear. The day had been unremarkable‚Äîa blur of lectures and half-finished notes. By evening, nestled back in the blue glow of my room, I opened <span class="platform-name">Platform-With</span>. It was a habitual gesture, my thumb moving on its own to call Mesum. Our evening calls were the punctuation at the end of the day, a way to decompress and laugh about nothing in particular.</p>
        
        <p>The tone rang out, a steady, pulsing beat. Once. Twice. Five times. Then, nothing. The call went to voicemail.</p>
        
        <p>I frowned. This was unusual. Mesum was almost pathologically connected to his phone. I tapped the call button again, the digital rings sounding more insistent this time. Again, they faded into silence.</p>
        
        <p>A faint prickle of unease traced a path down my spine. Maybe his phone died. Maybe he was caught up with family. I concocted a dozen harmless explanations, but none of them stuck. The image of his nervous cursor, that fleeting chat window, flashed unbidden in my mind. I pushed it away.</p>
        
        <p>Ten minutes passed. I tried again. And again. With each failed attempt, the harmless explanations began to curdle into something darker. Was he ignoring me? Had I done something wrong? The easy confidence of our friendship felt suddenly fragile. The silence on the other end of the line was no longer empty; it was filling with unspoken questions.</p>
        
        <p>I switched from calls to texts, my messages evolving in tone.</p>
        <p>4:32 PM: Yo, you there?</p>
        <p>4:45 PM: Everything good? Call me back.</p>
        <p>5:01 PM: Mesum? Seriously, what's up?</p>
        
        <p>Each message was a pebble dropped into a deep, dark well. I heard no splash, only a hollow, echoing silence. The blue light of the screen, once a comfort, now felt cold and accusatory. My room, usually a sanctuary, felt like a cage. I paced the floor, the sound of my own footsteps unnaturally loud. This wasn't just unusual; it was a fundamental break in the universe of our friendship.</p>
        
        <p>Finally, on what must have been the fifteenth try, the ringing stopped. There was a click of connection, a burst of static-filled breath. He was there.</p>
        
        <p>But the familiar "Hey, man" was absent. Instead, his voice was tight, stripped of its usual warmth. It was the voice of someone bracing for impact.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Did you check the group?"</div>
        
        <p>The question was so alien, so disconnected from my frantic concern, that my mind went blank. "What group?" I managed, my own voice sharp with confusion and lingering worry. I hated groups‚Äîthe constant, chaotic pings, the pressure to perform for an audience. He knew that.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">"Just wait," he said, and the line went dead.</div>
        
        <p>Not a goodbye, not an explanation. A command.</p>
        
        <p>I stared at the phone in my hand, the screen now dark. The prickle of unease had become a full-blown wave of anxiety. This wasn't about a dead battery or a family dinner. This was something else. Something orchestrated.</p>
        
        <p>A moment later, my phone lit up with a single, stark notification. An invitation. My thumb hovered over the screen, a strange sense of dread mixing with a morbid curiosity. This was the first step into the unknown. I took a deep breath and accepted.</p>
        
        <p>The group was named <span class="highlight">Circus Freaks</span>. And I, utterly bewildered, had just bought a ticket to the show.</p>

        The Big Top
      </h2>
      <div class="chapter-content">
        <p>The screen refreshed, and the "Circus Freaks" group chat bloomed across my monitor. The name itself felt like a taunt, written in bold letters at the top of the window. Below it were three profile pictures: Mesum's familiar gaming avatar, a brightly colored cartoon character I knew belonged to Amna, and one I had never seen before‚Äîa soft-focus photo of a flower. The stranger.</p>
        
        <p>For a long moment, nothing happened. It was just a static digital space, a waiting room. I felt like I had backstage access to a play I hadn't auditioned for, watching the empty stage, waiting for the actors to appear. My cursor blinked in the message box, a silent question mark. What was I supposed to say? What was the script?</p>
        
        <p>Then, the performance began.</p>
        
        <p>Amna's icon lit up. <span class="highlight">Amna: okay so why exactly are we all here? this is random.</span></p>
        
        <p>The flower avatar responded instantly. <span class="highlight">Rida: You're asking me? You're the admin. You added us. What's this about?</span></p>
        
        <p>The messages came in rapid succession, a volley of feigned confusion and genuine irritation. I sat frozen, my eyes darting between the lines of text. They were arguing, but there was a strange rhythm to it, a cadence that felt rehearsed. It was less a spontaneous disagreement and more like two actors hitting their marks with practiced precision.</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">Amna: I just thought it would be fun. Don't make it a big thing.</span></p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Rida: Adding people to a group called "Circus Freaks" without explanation IS a big thing. This is weird.</span></p>
        
        <p>I finally found my fingers on the keyboard. <span class="highlight">Me: Yeah, someone want to explain? Mesum?</span></p>
        
        <p>His name sat in the chat, unanswered. He was a ghost in the machine, observing but not participating. The feeling of being manipulated, of dancing on strings I couldn't see, tightened around me. This was his doing. He had brought me here, and now he was silent.</p>
        
        <p>The argument between the two girls escalated, a whirlwind of typed accusations about boundaries and respect. And then, as if a director had given a signal, Amna delivered the line that changed everything.</p>
        
        <p>The typing indicator appeared under her name, blinking for an unnaturally long time, building suspense. Then, the message appeared, stark and simple.</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">Amna: Fine. You want to know why? It's because Rida has a crush. On you.</span></p>
        
        <p>She had tagged me. My username, right there in the center of the digital stage, a spotlight suddenly blinding me.</p>
        
        <p>The chat froze. The frantic typing stopped. The world shrank to those few words on the screen. A crush. On you. My mind went completely blank, then raced in a dozen contradictory directions. This had to be a joke. A mean, elaborate joke. I thought of the voice, the one from weeks ago. Rida. This was the girl whose voice had haunted me for a day. Was this connected? It couldn't be a coincidence.</p>
        
        <p>Before I could form a coherent thought, let alone a response, a new notification appeared, not in the public spectacle of the group, but as a private whisper in my ear.</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">Rida is sending you a message.</span></p>
        
        <p>My heart hammered against my ribs. This was the trap, and I was stepping right into it. With a click that felt like it had the weight of a thousand consequences, I opened the private chat.</p>
        
        <p>The first message was already there.</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">Rida: I am so so sorry about that. I can't believe she just said that.</span></p>
        
        <p>The performance had moved to a private audience. The circus was in full swing, and I, the bewildered spectator, had just been invited to join the act.</p>

        The Puppeteer's Advice
      </h2>
      <div class="chapter-content">
        <p>The private chat window felt like a confessional booth. Rida's message hung in the digital space, an apology that seemed to vibrate with a strange mix of embarrassment and anticipation. I stared at the words, <span class="highlight">I can't believe she just said that</span>, trying to read the tone. Was she genuinely mortified? Or was this the next carefully written line in the script?</p>
        
        <p>My fingers, clumsy and unsure, typed a reply.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Me: It's‚Ä¶ ok. I guess. Is it true?</span></p>
        
        <p>The question mark felt like the most significant punctuation of my life. I held my breath, waiting for the three dancing dots that would signal her response. They appeared almost instantly.</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">Rida: This is so embarrassing. I told Amna in confidence. I didn't think she'd do something like this. But‚Ä¶ yeah. It's true.</span></p>
        
        <p>A jolt, equal parts panic and a strange, fluttering excitement, shot through me. It was true. The girl with the voice, the one I'd prophetically claimed, had a crush on me. The absurdity of it was overwhelming. I was nobody special‚Äîjust a guy who preferred the quiet comfort of a few close friends to the drama of romance. Yet, here it was, undeniable.</p>
        
        <p>The conversation unfolded tentatively. She asked about my day. I asked about hers. It was stilted, polite, a dance of two people tiptoeing around the elephant in the room. Every word she typed, I scrutinized. Was this real? Was she really this nervous? She seemed genuine, her digital voice soft and apologetic. The memory of Mesum's warnings felt distant, a paranoid fantasy compared to this immediate, thrilling connection.</p>
        
        <p>But I needed a reality check. I needed to hear the voice of the one person I still trusted.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">"Mesum. Hey. I'm talking to her," I said the moment he picked up the call, dispensing with any greeting.</div>
        
        <div class="quote">"Yeah? And?" His voice was flat, devoid of its usual energy.</div>
        
        <div class="quote">"And‚Ä¶ what do I do? Is this‚Ä¶ real?"</div>
        
        <p>There was a long pause on the other end of the line. I could hear him breathing, a soft static hiss. It was the pause of someone choosing their words with extreme care.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">"Look," he finally said, his tone lowering into something grave, almost conspiratorial. "I think you should go for it. Say yes."</div>
        
        <p>Relief washed over me. His blessing was the anchor I needed. But then he continued, and his next words turned the relief to ice.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">"But just‚Ä¶ be careful, okay?" he said. "After all, I was the one who denied her. You shouldn't."</div>
        
        <p>The line went quiet, but the words echoed in the silence, expanding to fill the entire room. <span class="highlight">I was the one who denied her. You shouldn't.</span></p>
        
        <p>It was not advice; it was a command wrapped in a riddle. What did that mean? Was it a warning that she was vengeful? That she was settling for me? Or was it a challenge, a dare from one friend to another? The simplicity of the conversation with Rida was instantly poisoned by this new, cryptic layer. Mesum was no longer just my friend; he was a puppeteer, and I could feel the strings tightening around my wrists.</p>
        
        <p>I ended the call and looked back at the chat window. Rida had sent another message, a simple, hopeful question mark.</p>
        
        <p>The two paths lay before me. One led back to my safe, predictable life, a life of unanswered questions and paranoid doubts. The other led into the unknown, into a story that was already being written for me, a story that promised the thrill of the voice and the touch of a girl who seemed to see something in me I didn't see in myself.</p>
        
        <p>I made my choice.</p>
        
        <p>My fingers moved to the keyboard, the keys clicking with a finality that sounded like fate.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Me: So‚Ä¶ what happens now?</span></p>
        
        <p>I had accepted the role. The curtain was rising on the second act.</p>

        The Warnings
      </h2>
      <div class="chapter-content">
        <p>The days that followed were a study in surreal contrast. My phone, once a simple tool for connection, became the center of a strange double life.</p>
        
        <p>By day, it was a portal to a budding, innocent world. Rida and I fell into a gentle rhythm. Our messages were the stuff of normalcy, and that was what made them so intoxicating. We shared the mundane details of our lives like secrets. <span class="highlight">Rida: I aced that math quiz I was stressing about!</span> <span class="highlight">Me: My dog just tried to fight his own reflection. It was a draw.</span> We talked about music, about the books we pretended to have read, about our favorite, most forgettable TV shows. It was easy. It was light. With every exchanged meme and every "good morning" text, the initial shock of the "Circus Freaks" reveal faded, replaced by a genuine, warming curiosity. The performance felt like it was over, and something real had begun.</p>
        
        <p>But as the sun set, a shadow fell over our digital idyll. The warnings began.</p>
        
        <p>It started subtly. A single message from Mesum, timestamped late in the evening.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Mesum: You guys still talking?</span></p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Me: Yeah, it's cool. It's normal.</span></p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Mesum: Just be careful, man.</span></p>
        
        <p>The first time, I dismissed it. It was just Mesum being Mesum‚Äîoverprotective, a little cynical. The guardian of our shared, comfortable solitude.</p>
        
        <p>But the messages didn't stop. They evolved. They became a dark ritual, a nightly check-in that felt less like concern and more like surveillance.</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">Mesum: Don't get in too deep.</span></p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Mesum: Keep your eyes open.</span></p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Mesum: There's something off. I can feel it.</span></p>
        
        <p>The words were vague, but their effect was precise. They were tiny drops of poison, tainting the well of my new happiness. I'd be smiling at a funny message from Rida, and then Mesum's name would flash on my screen with another ominous, unhelpful fragment. My joy would curdle into anxiety.</p>
        
        <p>I began to scrutinize my conversations with Rida, searching for the "something off" Mesum sensed. Did she pause too long before answering a simple question? Was that emoji she used a sign of deception? My own mind, fueled by his suggestions, became my enemy. Paranoia is a seed that needs very little water to grow, and Mesum was a relentless rain.</p>
        
        <p>Our voice calls changed, too. They were no longer the easy, rambling conversations of before. They were short, tense.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Hey, everything good with you two?" he'd ask, his voice tight.</div>
        <div class="quote">"Yeah, it's fine. Why?" I'd counter, frustration edging into my tone.</div>
        <div class="quote">"Just asking. Later."</div>
        
        <p>He would hang up, leaving me alone with the silence and the multiplying questions. He was the lighthouse keeper warning of rocks, but he was refusing to shine his light on the specific danger. He was making me afraid of the fog itself.</p>
        
        <p>The contrast was tearing me in two. By day, I was a boy tentatively stepping into the sunlight of first love. By night, I was a detective in a case with no crime, examining every word for evidence of a betrayal I couldn't name. Rida represented a future that was bright and unknown; Mesum represented a past that was safe but now felt like a cage.</p>
        
        <p>The weight of the unsaid became unbearable. The warnings were no longer something I could ignore. They were a constant, low-grade hum of dread in the background of my life. I was living in a beautiful house, but Mesum was daily telling me the foundation was cracked. I couldn't enjoy the view anymore without fearing the whole thing would collapse.</p>
        
        <p>I knew what I had to do. I could no longer live with his cryptic prophecies. I needed the truth, no matter how much it hurt.</p>
        
        <p>The next time his name flashed on my screen with another "be careful," I didn't reply with a simple "ok." I typed two words that demanded an end to the games.</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">Me: We need to talk.</span></p>

        The Screenshot
      </h2>
      <div class="chapter-content">
        <p>The confrontation happened not on a call, but in the stark, unforgiving medium of text. I couldn't risk hearing his voice, the practiced tones of my oldest friend, and being swayed by them. This required the cold, permanent record of words on a screen.</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">Me: We need to talk. Now. No more vague warnings. What is going on?</span></p>
        
        <p>The three dots appeared, danced, and disappeared. They reappeared, a nervous pulse. He was choosing his words with more care than ever.</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">Mesum: What do you mean? I'm just looking out for you.</span></p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">Me: That's not good enough. You've been telling me to "be careful" for days. Careful of what? Of her? Why? You told me to go for it. Nothing adds up. Either you tell me what you know, or I'm done with this.</span></p>
        
        <p>The threat was hollow, and we both knew it. But the frustration was real. The pressure cooker of suspicion he had sealed me inside was ready to blow.</p>
        
        <p>The dots danced for a long, agonizing minute. Then, a single message appeared.</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">Mesum: You're not going to like it.</span></p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">Me: I don't care. I need to know.</span></p>
        
        <p>There was no reply. Instead, a file notification popped up. He was sending me an image. My thumb hovered over the screen, a strange calm settling over me. This was it. The moment of truth, delivered in pixels.</p>
        
        <p>I tapped the image. It expanded, a screenshot of a group chat I wasn't in. The participants were Mesum, Amna, and Rida. The date stamp at the top made my stomach lurch: <span class="highlight">April 1</span>.</p>
        
        <p>My eyes, moving faster than my brain could process, scanned the messages.</p>
        
        <p>It was all there. The entire architecture of the deception, laid bare in laughing emojis and casual cruelty.</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">Amna: ok he's in the group. showtime?</span></p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Rida: lol this is gonna be epic. is he freaking out?</span></p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Mesum: just called him. played it perfectly. he has no idea.</span></p>
        
        <p>Then, the climax of their performance‚Äîthe moment after Amna had "revealed" Rida's secret in the Circus Freaks group. The messages in this private chat were a victory lap.</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">Rida: OMG you guys are amazing! Oscars should be given to you guys!!</span></p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Amna: hahaha his face must have been priceless!</span></p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Mesum: told you he'd fall for it. he's so gullible.</span></p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">Gullible.</span></p>
        
        <p>The word was a physical blow. I felt the air leave my lungs. The blue light of my phone screen seemed to intensify, bleaching the color from my face. The room tilted.</p>
        
        <p>It was all a lie. The voice note that had captivated me? A lure. The nervous confession in the private chat? A performance. The daily conversations, the shared routines, the budding feelings‚Ä¶ all of it was a scripted joke. An April Fool's prank. I was the fool.</p>
        
        <p>The cold clarity was absolute, and it was devastating. Every warning from Mesum, every "be careful," was not a friend's concern. It was the guilty conscience of a co-conspirator, a pathetic attempt to mitigate his own role in the cruelty. "After all, I denied her. You shouldn't." It wasn't a warning about her; it was a boast. He had set the trap, and I, the gullible fool, had walked right into it.</p>
        
        <p>The initial shock gave way to a cold, focused rage. It wasn't a hot, screaming anger. It was a quiet, determined fury that settled in my bones. They had made me a character in their pathetic little play. They had turned my first tentative steps toward connection into a public spectacle.</p>
        
        <p>But the show was over.</p>
        
        <p>I looked at the screenshot one last time, memorizing the words, the dates, the laughing emojis. This wasn't just a betrayal by a girl I barely knew. This was a betrayal by the person I trusted most.</p>
        
        <p>The hurt was a raw, open wound. But the desire for revenge‚Äînot a violent one, but a poetic, fitting one‚Äîwas the bandage I clung to. They wanted a circus? They would get one. But I would be writing the final act.</p>
        
        <p>I didn't reply to Mesum. There was nothing left to say to him. Instead, I opened a new chat. It was time to bring in the only other person who understood the depth of this betrayal. The one who had been used just as I had, even if she didn't know it yet.</p>
        
        <p>The plan began to form, cold and clear. The pranksters were about to become the pranked.</p>

        The Reckoning
      </h2>
      <div class="chapter-content">
        <p>The plan was born not from heat, but from ice. The white-hot shock of the screenshot had cooled into a crystalline determination. They had staged a performance for me; I would stage a better one for them.</p>
        
        <p>My first message wasn't to Mesum or Amna. It was to the other casualty of their joke, the girl with the flower avatar‚ÄîRida. I needed to know if she was a villain or a fellow prisoner.</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">Me: We need to talk. In private. It's about the group.</span></p>
        
        <p>Her reply was swift, laced with a nervous energy that felt different from her earlier acting.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Rida: Ok‚Ä¶ what's up?</span></p>
        
        <p>I didn't send the screenshot. Not yet. Instead, I probed.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Me: This whole thing feels set up. The group. Amna's "reveal." Does any of this feel real to you?</span></p>
        
        <p>The three dots blinked for a long time.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Rida: I‚Ä¶ I thought it was just a stupid joke at first. But talking to you‚Ä¶ that started to feel real. I'm sorry.</span></p>
        
        <p>A part of me, the part that still wanted the fairy tale to be true, latched onto her words. But the wiser, wounded part saw it for what it was: more script. She was staying in character. She was in on it. Any lingering doubt evaporated. We were all actors, but only some of us knew the play was a farce.</p>
        
        <p>It was time for the final act.</p>
        
        <p>I opened the "Circus Freaks" group. The name now felt like a perfect, bitter irony. I took a deep breath, my fingers poised over the keyboard. The stage was set.</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">Me: @Mesum Seriously? You're just going to ignore me now?</span></p>
        
        <p>The line hung in the digital silence. I could imagine the alerts popping up on their phones, the sudden attention. A minute passed. Then, his response, perfectly timed.</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">Mesum: Ignore you about what? You're being dramatic.</span></p>
        
        <p>And so it began. Our argument unfolded with a brutal, convincing rhythm. We volleyed accusations back and forth, each message designed to escalate the tension. We dragged up old, minor grievances from years of friendship and inflated them into unforgivable betrayals. We typed with the fury of two people whose entire shared history was crumbling to dust.</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">Me: You've always been jealous. You can't stand that someone might actually care about me!</span></p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Mesum: You're so naive! You'll believe anything anyone tells you! You're an easy target!</span></p>
        
        <p>It was a vicious, public unraveling. Amna and Rida leaped into the fray, their messages panicked.</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">Amna: STOP! Both of you! What is wrong with you?</span></p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Rida: This is crazy! Just talk it out!</span></p>
        
        <p>Their pleas were the soundtrack we needed. They were the audience, gasping at the drama, completely unaware they were watching a play within a play. We were giving them the show they deserved.</p>
        
        <p>Then, I delivered my line, the one we had agreed upon. The words felt like shards of glass in my throat as I typed them, a painful fiction that mirrored my real, inner devastation.</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">Me: You know what? We're done. I can't do this anymore. Fifteen years of friendship, and this is how it ends. Over a girl and your pathetic jealousy. Don't ever talk to me again.</span></p>
        
        <p>I paused, letting the finality of it sink into the digital space. The chat was frozen. No one typed. I could feel their shock through the screen. This had gone further than they ever imagined.</p>
        
        <p>And then, I uploaded the screenshot.</p>
        
        <p>I let it sit there for a moment, a silent, damning piece of evidence. Below it, I typed the caption that would serve as our final bow.</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">Me: You guys did this. I did this. Enjoy your Oscars.</span></p>
        
        <p>I didn't wait for a response. I exited the group, blocked Mesum and Amna, and closed the app. The silence in my room was absolute. The performance was over.</p>
        
        <p>There was no victory in it. Only the hollow ache of a friendship I had just publicly executed, and the bitter taste of a love that had never been real. The circus tent had collapsed, and I was left standing alone in the wreckage, the dust of the betrayal settling around me. The reckoning was complete, but it felt less like a triumph and more like a funeral.</p>
